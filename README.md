### Overview

This project is a comprehensive data exploration and analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic using SQL Server. The dataset used for this project is sourced from the 'Our World in Data' website, which provides detailed information on COVID-19 cases, vaccination rates, and other relevant metrics across various countries.

### Objectives

- To clean and preprocess the raw COVID-19 data for better analysis.
- To explore trends in COVID-19 cases, vaccination rates, and other critical indicators.
- To perform SQL queries to gain insights and visualize the pandemic's impact across different regions.
- To utilize SQL Server for managing, querying, and visualizing large datasets.

### Data Source:

- COVID-19 cases and deaths
- Vaccination rates
- Testing statistics
- Hospitalizations and ICU admissions

### SQL Queries & Analysis

#### Case and Death Analysis:

Queries to analyze the number of cases and deaths globally and by country.

#### Vaccination Trends:

Analysis of vaccination rates and trends over time.

#### Testing Data:

Insights into testing rates and positivity ratios.

#### Regional Comparisons:

Comparing the pandemic's impact across different countries and regions.

#### Hospitalization Data:

Analysis of hospitalization and ICU admissions related to COVID-19.

### Tools & Technologies
